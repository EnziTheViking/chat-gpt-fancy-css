# Original Project :arrow_heading_down:
## chat-gpt
This is ChatGPT conversation saving bookmark.
It's started as [DEV.to article](https://dev.to/jcubic/save-chatgpt-as-html-file-dhh).
But I've decided that It would be better to track it on GitHub and update so it will still work,
when OpenAI change their application.
